## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive Python tutorial. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to brush up on your Python skills, this guide will provide you with the knowledge you need to become proficient in Python programming.

## Why Learn Python?

- **Versatility**: Python is used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
- **Ease of Learning**: Python's syntax is clear and readable, making it an excellent choice for beginners.
- **Community and Libraries**: Python has a vast community and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

## Setting Up Python

To get started with Python programming, you'll need to set up a development environment. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the official website (python.org). Make sure to add Python to your PATH.
2. **Choose an IDE/Text Editor**: Popular options include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook. Alternatively, you can use a simple text editor like Sublime Text.
3. **Verify Installation**: Once Python is installed, verify it by typing `python --version` in the terminal or command prompt.

## Python Basics

Now that your environment is set up, letâ€™s start with the basics. In this section, we'll cover:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Learn how to declare and use variables in Python.
- **Control Structures**: Understand how to use conditional statements and loops.
- **Functions**: Learn how to write reusable code blocks.

### Installing Python
To start programming in Python, you need to have Python installed on your system. Download it from the official website (python.org) and follow the installation instructions.

### Writing Your First Python Program
Let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program to get you started.

```python
print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!
```

### Variables and Data Types
```python
name = "Pk"
age = 25
is_student = True

print(name)           # Output: Pk
print(age)            # Output: 25
print(is_student)     # Output: True

integer_number = 42
float_number = 3.14
string_text = "Hello, Python!"
boolean_value = True

print(integer_number)  # Output: 42
print(float_number)    # Output: 3.14
print(string_text)     # Output: Hello, Python!
print(boolean_value)   # Output: True

```

### Control Structures
```python

age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
    # Output: You are an adult.
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")
    # Output: Count: 0, Count: 1, Count: 2, Count: 3, Count: 4

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    count += 1

```

## Functions
### Defining and Calling Functions

```python

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # Output: Hello, Alice!

greet("Alice")

```
### Function with Default Arguments

```python
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

print(power(3))    # Output: 9 (3^2)
print(power(3, 3)) # Output: 27 (3^3)

```

## Intermediate Python

### Lists 
Ordered, mutable, allows duplicates.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] 
fruits.append("date") # Adds date to the end of the list
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_list[2])  # Output: 3

my_list[1] = 10
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 10, 3, 4, 5]
    
my_list.remove(10)   # Removes the first occurrence of 10 from the list
print(my_list)       # Output: [1, 3, 4, 5]
```
### Tuples
 Tuples are immutable sequences in Python. Once created, their elements cannot be changed.
```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[0])  # Output: 10


```
### Dictionaries 
unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is associated with a value. Dictionaries allowing you to change their contents.
```python

my_dict = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25,
    'city': 'New York'
}
print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: Alice
print(my_dict.get('age'))  # Output: 25

my_dict['age'] = 26
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26, 'city': 'New York'}

```
### Sets 
Unordered, mutable, unique elements.
```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
unique_numbers.add(6)
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

```

## Advanced Python

### Classes and Objects

```python

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age, grade):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.grade = grade

    def display(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}, Grade: {self.grade}")

s1 = Student("Alice", 20, 85.5)
s1.display()

```
### Importing Modules

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))

```

### Reading from a File

```python
# Assume 'example.txt' contains the text "Hello, file!"
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Output: Hello, file!


```

### Writing to a File

```python
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, file!")
# This writes "Hello, file!" to 'example.txt'

```
### Try-Except Block

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")  # Output: Cannot divide by zero!
finally:
    print("Execution complete.")    # Output: Execution complete.


```

### Lists with User Input and Loop

```python
# Initialize an empty list
numbers = []

# Number of elements to be added to the list
n = int(input("How many numbers do you want to enter? "))

# Loop to take user input and add to the list
for i in range(n):
    num = int(input(f"Enter number {i+1}: "))
    numbers.append(num)

# Loop to print each element in the list
print("The numbers you entered are:")
for number in numbers:
    print(number)


# How many numbers do you want to enter? 3
# Enter number 1: 5
# Enter number 2: 10
# Enter number 3: 15
# The numbers you entered are:
# 5
# 10
# 15

```

### Nested Loops for Printing a Matrix

```python
# Define the size of the matrix
rows = 3
cols = 3

# Loop through each row
for i in range(rows):
    # Loop through each column in the current row
    for j in range(cols):
        # Print the product of the row and column indices
        print(i * j, end=' ')  # Output: Product of i and j, with space separation
    print()  # Newline after each row

# 0 0 0 
# 0 1 2 
# 0 2 4 

```
