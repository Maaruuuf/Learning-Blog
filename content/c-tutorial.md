## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive C tutorial. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to brush up on your C skills, this guide will provide you with the knowledge you need to become proficient in C programming.



## Why Learn C?

- **Foundation for Other Languages**: C provides the building blocks for many modern languages, such as C++, Java, and Python.
- **Performance**: C is highly efficient and is used in performance-critical applications.
- **Low-level Control**: C allows you to work closely with memory and hardware, providing more control over system resources.

## Setting Up C

To get started with C programming, you'll need to set up a development environment. Here are the steps:

1. **Install a C Compiler**: You can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for Linux/macOS or MinGW for Windows. Both are free and widely used.
2. **Choose an IDE/Text Editor**: Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or Eclipse. Alternatively, you can use a simple text editor like Sublime Text.
3. **Verify Installation**: Once the compiler is installed, verify it by typing `gcc --version` in the terminal or command prompt.

## C Basics

Now that your environment is set up, let’s start with the basics. In this section, we'll cover:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Learn how to declare and use variables in C.
- **Control Structures**: Understand how to use conditional statements and loops.
- **Functions**: Learn how to write reusable code blocks.


### Installing a C Compiler
To start programming in C, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. Popular choices include GCC for Linux and MinGW for Windows. You can also use integrated development environments (IDEs) like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio.

### Writing Your First C Program
Let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program to get you started.

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h> // Include standard input-output library

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n"); // Output: Hello, World!
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

### Variables and Data Types

```c showLineNumbers 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 5.9;
    char initial = 'A';

    printf("Age: %d, Height: %.1f, Initial: %c\n", age, height, initial); 
    // Age: 25, Height: 5.9, Initial: A
    return 0;
}
```

### Control Structures

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 20;

    if (age >= 18) {
        printf("You are an adult.\n"); 
        // Output: You are an adult.
    } else {
        printf("You are a minor.\n");
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Count: %d\n", i);
         // Output: Count: 0, Count: 1, Count: 2, Count: 3, Count: 4
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Functions

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h>

void greet(char name[]) {
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name); // Output: Hello, Alice!
}

int main() {
    greet("Alice");
    return 0;
}
```

## Intermediate C

Once you are familiar with the basics, it's time to explore more advanced features of C:

- **Arrays and Pointers**: Learn how to work with arrays and pointers, which are fundamental in C programming.
- **File I/O**: Understand how to read from and write to files.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Explore memory management using `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`.

### Arrays and Pointers

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int *ptr = numbers;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Number: %d, Address: %p\n", *(ptr + i), (ptr + i)); 
        // Number: 1, Address: 0x... Number: 2, Address: 0x... Number: 3, Address: 0x... Number: 4, Address: 0x... Number: 5, Address: 0x...
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### File I/O

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h>  

int main() {  
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");  // Open a file named "example.txt" in write mode and assign the file pointer to 'file'
    if (file == NULL) {  // Check if the file was opened successfully
        printf("Error opening file!\n");  // Print an error message if the file cannot be opened
        return 1;  // Return a non-zero value to indicate an error
    }

    fprintf(file, "Hello, File!\n");  // Write the string "Hello, File!\n" to the file
    fclose(file);  // Close the file to ensure all data is written and resources are freed

    return 0;  
}

```

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> // Include standard library for memory allocation functions

int main() { 
    int *arr; // Declare a pointer to an integer
    int size = 5; // Declare and initialize an integer variable to hold the size of the array

    arr = (int*) malloc(size * sizeof(int)); // Allocate memory for an array of integers

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { // Loop through the array
        arr[i] = i + 1; // Assign values to the array elements
        printf("Value: %d\n", arr[i]); // Print the value of each array element
    }

    free(arr); // Free the allocated memory

    return 0; 
}
```

## Advanced C

Now that you are comfortable with intermediate topics, let’s move on to some advanced C programming concepts:

- **Structures**: Learn how to group different data types together.
- **Pointers to Functions**: Explore how to use pointers with functions for flexibility.
- **Memory Management**: Delve deeper into memory management and optimization.

### Structures

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h> 

struct Student { 
    char name[50]; 
    int age; 
    float grade; 
};

int main() { 
    struct Student s1 = {"Alice", 20, 85.5}; // Initialize a Student structure with name "Alice", age 20, and grade 85.5

    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Grade: %.2f\n", s1.name, s1.age, s1.grade); // Print the details of the student
    return 0; 
}
```

### Pointers to Functions

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h> 

void add(int a, int b) { 
    printf("Sum: %d\n", a + b); 
}

int main() { 
    void (*func_ptr)(int, int) = &add; // Declare a function pointer 'func_ptr' and assign it the address of 'add'
    func_ptr(10, 20); // Call the function 'add' using the function pointer with arguments 10 and 20

    return 0; 
}
```

### Memory Management

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *arr;
    int size = 10;

   arr = (int*) malloc(size * sizeof(int)); // Allocate memory for an array of integers

if (arr == NULL) { // Check if the memory allocation failed
    printf("Memory not allocated.\n"); // Print an error message if allocation failed
    return 1; // Return with an error code
}

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { // Loop through the array
    arr[i] = i * 2; // Assign each element a value that is double its index
    printf("Value: %d\n", arr[i]); // Print the value of each element
}

free(arr); // Free the allocated memory

    return 0;
}
```
